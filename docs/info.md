## How it works

This project implements a basic 8-bit Direct Digital Synthesiser (DDS) that outputs a digitized sine wave with a user-defined frequency.

- The user provides an 8-bit phase increment (`phase_inc`) via the `ui_in[7:0]` pins
- A rising edge on `uio_in[0]` (`load_freq`) loads this value into DDS
- If no `load_freq` trigger is applied, the DDS runs at a default low frequency (corresponding to `phase_inc = 8'd1`)

Internally, a **phase accumulator** adds `phase_inc` to a phase register on each clock cycle. The 8-bit output of the accumulator directly indexes a sine look-up table (LUT) with 256 entries. Each LUT value corresponds to a digtized amplitude sample of a sine wave. These values are sent to `uo_out[7:0]`, which can be converted to an analog waveform using an external R-2R DAC.

The output frequency is given by the standard DDS formula:

f_out = (phase_inc / 2^N) * f_clk, 

where,
- `phase_inc` is the user-defined tuning word (8 bits)
- `N = 8` is the size of the phase accumulator (for this simplified implementation)
- `f_clk = 66 MHz` is the system clock

This design is based on principles described in Analog Devices’ application note:

## How to test

1. Connect an 8-bit DIP switch or microcontroller output to `ui_in[7:0]` to set the frequency
2. Pulse `uio_in[0]` high momentarily to load the new value
3. Connect `uo_out[7;0]` to an R-2R DAC to view the generated sine wave
4. You can low pass filter the DAC output to generate a smooth wave

Example:
- Phase increment = `8'b00000001` produces a wave of ~258 kHz
- Phase increment = `8'b10000000` produces a wave of ~33 MHz (Nyquist limit)

## External hardware
- DIP switches or a microcontroller can be used to control the frequency (`ui_in`) and trigger (`uio_in[0]`)
- An **8-bit R-2R resistor ladder DAC** is required to convert `uo_out[7:0]` into an analog sine waveform
